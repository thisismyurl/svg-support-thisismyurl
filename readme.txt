Bring your professional photography workflow directly into WordPress. Safely upload RAW files and automate their conversion into high-performance, next-gen web formats.

== Description ==

**RAW Support by thisismyurl.com** is the definitive performance utility for photographers who want to bridge the gap between their camera and their website.

Traditionally, WordPress prevents the upload of RAW files because they are too large and complex for the web. This plugin removes those barriers, allowing you to manage your source photography within your Media Library while ensuring your site remains lightning-fast for visitors.

### Professional Workflow, Web Performance
Why waste time manually developing JPEGs for your site? With RAW Support, you can upload your high-fidelity files directly. If you use our **WebP Support** or **AVIF Support** plugins, this tool will automatically "develop" your RAW uploads into ultra-lightweight, next-gen formats upon entry.

### Key Benefits & Features:
* **Universal RAW Support:** Unlocks support for Canon (.cr2, .cr3), Nikon (.nef, .nrw), Sony (.arw), Adobe (.dng), Fujifilm (.raf), and more.
* **Automated Image Conversion:** Transform massive RAW data into web-ready WebP or AVIF formats instantly.
* **Preserve Site Speed:** Keep your high-quality visuals without the heavy file sizes that hurt SEO and user experience.
* **Smart Suite Integration:** Automatically detects sibling plugins to expand your handling and conversion options.
* **Intuitive Quality Control:** Use precision sliders in the Tools menu to balance perfect clarity with maximum compression.


== Installation ==

1. Upload the `raw-support-thisismyurl` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Navigate to **Tools > RAW Support** to choose your handling mode.
